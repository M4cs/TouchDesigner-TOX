## TouchDesigner TOX

These are components I've written myself to make life easier in TouchDesigner or get around some things...

### EnhancedBlobTrack V2

**Pros:**
- Unlimited blobs on free license
- Same parameters and pretty much the same as the original blobTrack
- Uses different OpenCV algorithm for blob searching and diff

**Cons:**
- Usually runs at 50fps instead of 60fps (Turn off render and it should process faster)
- More blobs than the original blobTrack
